# Dockerfile will define what goes on in the environment inside your container.
# Access to resources like networking interfaces and disk drives is virtualized inside this environment,
# which is isolated from the rest of your system, so you have to map ports to the outside world, and be specific
# about what files you want to “copy in” to that environment. However, after doing that, you can expect that
# the build of your app defined in this Dockerfile will behave exactly the same wherever it runs.
